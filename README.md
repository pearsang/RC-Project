# RC-Project

#### Main Idea
The goal of this project is to implement a simple auction platform. Users can open (host) an auction to sell some asset, and close it, as well list ongoing auctions and make bids.

The development of the project requires implementing an Auction Server (AS) and a User Application (User). The AS and multiple User application instances are intended to operate simultaneously on different machines connected to the Internet.

The AS will be running on a machine with known IP address and ports.

#### Commands
To learn the commands please read the [instructions](instructions.pdf).

#### How to run 
In order to run the client you must run:

    make user
    ./user

This project was developed as an assignment of the Computer Networks course.
